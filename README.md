# Beam Size Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) ðŸ¤“
This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the optimal beam size for structural engineering applications. The goal is to automate the process of determining preliminary beam dimensions based on various input features using machine learning techniques.

### Project Overview
The Beam Size Prediction project utilizes ANN models to predict the size of beams (such as cross-sectional dimensions) based on the input parameters. This helps structural engineers in early-stage design by providing quick, data-driven estimates of beam dimensions.

### Features
Beam Size Prediction: Predicts beam dimensions (e.g., b/dRatio, c/dRatio, etc.) based on features such as:
Concrete Grade (ConcreteGrade)
Rebar Grade (RebarGrade)
Applied Moment (Moment)
Steel Strain (SteelStrain)
c/d Ratio (c/dRatio)
b/d Ratio (b/dRatio)
Rebar Ratio (RebarRatio)
ANN Model: Utilizes a neural network to model the nonlinear relationships between input features and beam dimensions.
Flexible Input: The model can be trained with different datasets and adapted to various design standards.
