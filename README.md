# Beam Size Prediction  ðŸ¤“
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the optimal beam size for structural design using machine learning models. The model is designed to assist structural engineers in quickly determining the preliminary dimensions of beams based on a set of input architectural and structural parameters.

### Features â˜˜
Predicts the beam size (e.g., cross-sectional dimensions) based on input features such as concrete grade, steel grade, moment, and strain values.
Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques for regression to provide accurate predictions.
Easily integrates with engineering software like ETABS for structural analysis and design.
Can be customized to adapt to various standards and regional design codes.
